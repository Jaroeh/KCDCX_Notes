** Intro to web Components
    * New API's in browser, custom tags w/o a framework

    * 4 Specs
        * Custom Elements  - write your own tags, nestable
        * HTML Imports - include HTML pages inside pages.
            * Link import tag.
            * built in de-dupe
        * template tags -  html, markup, script, styles
            * parses but doesn't browser doesn't render
            * browser will let you clone it and then insert into the dom
        * Shadow DOM - encapsulate components , style blocks.
            * hides css styles
            * HTML examples, select, video

    * API's exist on mobile currenty

    * whats' google polymer
        * Library and Project.
        * webcomponents.org - library of of components

    * tinyurl.com/comcast-toast  - example in class / workshop ( gitbub)

    * usage,
        * class sytanx , extends HTMLElement
        * 3 'special' callbacks required.
            * Connected
            * diconnected
            * attribute changed
        * tag requires a hyphen ( so that it's not confused by browser as an internal element)
        * createChildren needs to happen in the connected callback ( this.innerHtml = "Hello world")
            * this reeferences the custom element
        * diconnected gets called when element is removed from the DOM

        * CSS - ShadowDOM overwrites page css
            * this.attachShadow( {mode:open});
                * mode open - benefit lets you referene the element
                * mode closed - can't see shadow root, no referencing from the DOM
            * doesn't create a complete boundry - things will go into your component
                * adding a style tag inside applies only to the component
                    * use :host selector to reference the component
                    * these styles will not 'leak' out

        * CSS Variables - avaiable in most all browsers now
        * can import external CSS

        * <slot>  - any childern in here take then and put them into the slot element
            * can have named slots.
        * ShadowDOM query selector - can't traverse into the element  - full traversing needed to reference view selenium

        * Vanilla component
