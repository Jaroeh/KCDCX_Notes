* Deep Learning with TensorFlow

* don't be affraid of AI and ML.
* it's not that we don't know what machine Learning does, it's that we have a hard time explaining it
* AI -> Machine Learning -> deep learning

* ML is only as good as your data represents reality
- tay represented a snapshot of humanity
- data is biased
s
1. process - have a good question , identify the data
2. clean the data.
3. build the model
4. use model to make predictions

* train the algorithm and then test data.
    - train, dev, test

* confusion matrix
precision = tp / tp + fp   (where tp = true positive and fp = false positive)
accuracy = tp + tn / tp+ tn +fp +fn

* differnce between deep learning and machine learning

- TensorFlowSharp, c# api -  https://github.com/migueldeicaza/TensorFlowSharp
- TensorBoard - view the optimization of the model
- pyTorch
