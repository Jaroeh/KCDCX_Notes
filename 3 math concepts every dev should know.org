** 3 Math Concepts Every Dev Should Know
- Matthew L Perry

* Inudsrtry is built on Math

1. predicate calculus
2. Degrees of freedom
3. Directed Graphs

* Math is useful for
    -Machine learning
    -games
    -stuff
    - errything

* Logic Reasoning / Completemess
    -Axioms
        - 0 is a natural number
        - if x is natural then x+1 is natural
    -Theorems
        - a+b = b+a


    * can all true statements be proven within these Theorems?
        - Godel solved this with a negative answer

    * Entscheeidungsproblem
        -Is there always a way to determine if something is true?
            - truth
            - satisfiability
            - validity


    * Unit tests are a good example of testing truth

* predicate calculus
    - prepositions - radar is a dog
    - predicate ( 1st level) - is x is a dog , then x is a mammal
    - predicate ( higher order) - if x is an A , then x is a B implies if x is not a B , then x is not an A


    * Boolean Algebra
        -

    * De Morgans's Theorems
        - not ( a or b ) = not A and Not B
        - Not (a and B) = Not A or Not B
        * use when refacorting conditional logic

    * quantifiers
        - existential
        - universal

    * we can use these to review our code and validate or write our requirements

* Degrees of freedom =  number of variables minus the number of contrstraints
    - Decision Tree

* Three kinds of state
    - Independent
    - Dependent
    - Immutable

* entity diagrams
* concuurency
    - shows oppurtinities for parrallism

* topological order
    - any sequence of the nodes such that the tail of each edge appears before the head




** Errata
    - Objectivity ( you tube channel)
    - dotnet code contracts
    - graphviz.org -  will graph a json dependency chart.
