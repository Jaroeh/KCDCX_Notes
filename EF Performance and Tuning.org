** EF Framework Perfomance Tuning

* Projects -- look at the branches for each project to see different revisions

* which is better Sporc or EF ?
- depends on query and context
- there is no silver bullet
- you can create and call sprocs from EF when needed.

* all examples here assume indexes are tuned  / applied

* There will always be a slight hit from using EF over ADO due to the abstraction layer
** Profiling
* profilers
    - SQL profilers
    - intellitrace
    - context.database.log
    - EFProf
    - ORMProfiler
    - MiniProfiler

- Use test execution for run one test.
    - use profiler or another tool to view the queries on the database

* Projections
- don't use models directly, push results into a DTO

* Async
    - use Async / await to do EF queries in parallel
    - EF is not Thread Safe!
        - use a seperate dbcontext for concurrent queries
        - dbcontext.contextFactory() to create a new instance of the context

* Don't use .Count for a check, use .Any to verify that there are records if you don't need the count.

* EF Vs. Dapper
- dapper is faster than EF unless you disable tracking in EF , then they are quite similar

* queries
- find - only works of keyID , checks change tracer first
- first
- firstordefault
- single is the worst performing ( select top x) throws exception if more than one
- singleOrDefault
- where

* searching
- iQueryable is the definition of the query . build and then extend the query from that.  it is not the result set. will use same base cached execution plan


** Errata
* Unit Tests , use trace.write instead of console.writeline
* .Include will include children (relations ) rather than lazy load them
    - include will effectivly do a select * , which ignores the indexes
* Debug DB queries
    * context.database.log = val => trace.writeline(val);
* By default EF tracks ALL objects for changes,   you can turn off and sometimes get a performance gain
* You can create your indexes manually in code first w/ migrations
* EF Core outperforms EF 6
