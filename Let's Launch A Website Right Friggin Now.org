* insstrutors sites
    - http://damn.dog
    - http://idiots.win
    - http://greatsex.tips
    - http://partypartypartyparty.party

    - all of those sites were quick to build
    - no backend code
    - FUN

* one thing: complex systesm make for complex systesm
    - BUT - tight scopes allow you to think about Websites differently

* creating a new site just for KCDC

* tech stack
    - SASS
        - CSS copmlied
    - PUG
        - python-ish front end language ( HTML )
    - VUE
        - JS

*  preprocessor
    - could use NPM and install errything
        - then edit package.json and gulpfile to define how it all works together
        - this would generate 36 megs of code before compiling

    * PrePros - preprocessor that takes care of everything that NPM would take care of
        - basically gulp in a UI
        - writes your GULP for you
        - $29 for a single user

* app built
* setup domain
    - set branch to be setup in github by github pages,  this will serve index.html from github
    - https through cloudflare
    - route www to github

    * OR
     - without cloudlare you can send it to github {Username.github.io} as the cname for www DNS

* site is now live at https://pretend.world  to see the site that was built
