#+TITLE: From Dev to Data Scientist

* code is a tool to solve the problem

* expected 40% growth by 2020, expected shortage of 259k jobs by 2024
* focus on infrastructure, analytics, and applications
* Big Data  - key metric, data size / volume
    * records, transactions, tables, & files
    * variety - s trutured, unsstructred, , semi structred
    * key is complexity
* velocity of data, amount of transactions  datapoints / time
* big data =  velocity, volume, variety

* skills
    * Hacking / Dev
        * tech
        * creativity
    * stats
        * choose procdedure
        * diagnose problems
        * develop procedures
    * machine learning is the overlap
    * SME / Domain expertise
        * values
        * goals
        * constraints
    * Social Sciences

** buzzwords
    * Data Lake - lots of data sitting there.  parked data
    * data mining - finding value in data
    * unsstructred data
    * dark data
    * fast data
    * edge analytics
    * predictive analytics

** skills
    * dta acquisition
    * data cleaning / transformatins
    * analytics
    * prescribing applications
    * programming automations

** the job
    * educate the business
    * design big data architecture
    * look for problems to solve
    * research new techniques
    * ETL / Collare data for analysis
    * implement algorithms
    * present insights

** the 5 questions
- classification , is this a or b
- anomaly detection - is this weird?
- regression - how much or how many?
- clustering - how is thei organized
- reinforced learning
