** Why Loop in JS when you can Map , Filter, Reduce

* thought of hte day: for loop are broken
    - map filter reduce can replace for loops

* we spend more time reading than writing code, lets make it more readable

* Array functions
    - .filter()
        - create a copy of original based on the test based in
    - .map()
        - create a new array from results of action on eery element in the calling array
    - .reduce()
        - applies a function against the accumulator and each element in the array ( from left to right) to reduce it to a single value
        - two arguments get passed in

- ^ gateway drugs to functional programming

- the 3 are chainable

* higher order functions
    - takes one or more functions as arguments

* arrow functions
    - added in ES6
    - shortens function syntax
    - does not have it's own this

* Using on arrays of objects
