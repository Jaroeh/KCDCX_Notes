** Material Design Spec: The “Why” for your CSS design

 - @jayharris

* proving the why behind the user interface

* it's about making the users happy

* why?
    - hopefully you have a designer on your team.
    - what does a designer do?
        - a designer makes it pretty? wrong
    - recognize the purpose
        - it makes people want to use the app
            - arguably more important than effcient code
            - if it's not performant, it's annoying but still usable
    - most dev teams don't have designers, this is why we have bootstrap

* why do we use bootstrap?
    - it makes pretty, but doesn't make it usable
    - "bootstrap is to developers what wordpress is to designers"

* why do users like bootstrap?
    - they don't
    - they don't care
    - it's not for users, it's for developers

* Approach
    - frameworks, bootstrap not dependant on the use, just the components available.
    - guidelines
        - not opinionated about implementation
        - opnianted about usage
    - requirements , we're misguided about this
        - features - user stories are misguided.
            - it's not about the feature
        - delivery
            - it's not about delivery
    - Consumption!
        - it's all about Consumption

* it's not making sure you can click the button and match the branding, it's about the interaction

* Material Design by Google
    - incredibly opinionated
    - incredibly specific in how implementation
        - it's specificity is in the why not the how
    - Material design is a response to two facts
        - if it's possible for the dev to screw up the design they will
        - the alternative to no design is bad design
    - Your UI tells the story
    - Material is built upon industrial design and the centuries of study behind it
    - Content
        - focus too much on Content
        - we interact with the container of the Content
    - Material's metaphor is a tactile metaphor for a physical experience.
        - quantum paper, it should interact like a sheet of paper for all containers
            - impenetrable, solid, unbendable
            - though it can be reshaped, split, and it can heal
            - depth, it's paper, it's not a box
                - thickness is a dp  = is a density independent pixel
            - whitespace is a first class citizen
                - not just the borders and what's between Content
                - it's also the depth
                - whitespace is significant
            - depth brings:
                -interaction
                - focus
                - hierarchy
            - our use of depth must be consistent
            - scrolling
                - it's not the content that moves , it's the paper
                - drop shadows show depth, they let you know that items are independently scrollable
        - text / ink
            - spec refers to it as ink ,   it's on the quantum paper
            - single font face at all times
            - simplify,  just like when you write on a sheet of paper, only one handwriting style
            - fonts  are based on relative size ( sp ) ( rems )
                - this is for accessibility
                - sp =  scalable pixel
                - never use px or pt always use rem for font size
            - language
                - buttons should always reflect the context of what's happening
                    - by looking at the button, I should know what will happen without reading the message box
                        - instead of OK and NO,  use DELETE and Cancel
                    - order is important
                        - the order that precedes the action should always be like a forward and back button
                            - cancel is like back, delete is the action that goes forward
            - color
                - readability is the primary goal
                - bold colors
                - primary and secondary pallette
                - always about contrast
                - if you turn the colors off, and into grayscale, you'll still be able to see everything
                - accessibility affects everyone  , not the blind
                    - distracted drivers
                    - cataracts
                    - we all see color differently
            - animation
                - motion is important
                - things don't magically move from point a to b , that' not how the real world works
                - movement should be fluid and natural
                - motion provides meaning
                - needs to be quick
                    - spec says that an animation entering the viewport can't be over 1/4 of a second
                    - exiting must be ~ 1/8 of a second
                - speed specs are device based
                - context specific
                - life isn't instantaneous, it's fluid
            - context
                - elements tie together to show the context
            - repetition
                - provides us the unity
                - can't have contrast without unity
        - these all together make everything accessible and cohesive
            - accessibility effects everyone!

        - it's about the usability
